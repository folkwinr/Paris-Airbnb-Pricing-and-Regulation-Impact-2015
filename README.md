# 🏙️ Paris Airbnb Pricing & Regulation Impact (2015)
### Decision-ready data story (2026 BI style)

## 🔥 One-line story
**After 2015 regulations, new host growth dropped sharply and average prices started rising again — likely due to reduced competition.**

---

## 🎯 Why this matters (So what?)
Paris restricted short-term rentals in 2015.  
This project shows a clear market signal:

- 🧑‍🏠 **Supply growth slowed** (fewer new hosts)
- 💰 **Prices increased again** (less competition)

**Trade-off:** regulation may protect housing, but it can reduce supply and raise prices for travelers.

---

## ✅ What I did (What we did)
I built 3 simple, chart-ready views:
- 🗺️ **Average price by neighbourhood** (find premium vs affordable areas)
- 🛏️ **Average price by accommodates** in the most expensive area (capacity → pricing)
- 📈 **Yearly trends**: new hosts + average price (before/after 2015)

Then I visualized them with clean charts to tell one clear story.

---

## 📌 Key findings (What happened?)
- **Neighbourhood is the biggest driver of price** (premium zones stand out)
- **Bigger capacity generally costs more** (but extreme groups can be thin data)
- **New hosts fall strongly after 2015**
- **Prices rise again as host growth slows**

---

## 🧭 What I would do next (Now what?)
To strengthen causality and make this decision-ready for policy/business:
- Compare **pre vs post 2015** more formally
- Break down by **neighbourhood segments** (hotspots vs residential)
- Add robust metrics (median/percentiles) for thin groups
